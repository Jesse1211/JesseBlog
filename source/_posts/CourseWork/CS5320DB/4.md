### Definitions

- Decomposing **tables** into pages, **pages** into slots, **slots** into fields
- Variable length content can be handled via **directories**

### Hardware - Storage

#### Relevance for DBMS

- **Capacity limits** force data to lower parts of hierarchy
- Data **access speed** may become bottleneck
- Design algorithms to **minimize data movements**
- **Random** data access is expensive
- Read data in larger **chunks ("pages")**
- Keep related data **close** together
- Take into account volatility for **recovery** considerations

#### Memory Hierarchy:

$$(\text{Volatile}): \text{Registers} \to \text{CPU Cache} \to \text{Main Memory} \to (\text{Non-Volatile}): \text{Flash/USB Memory} \to \text{Hard Disk} \to \text{Tape Backup}$$
$$\text{Faster Access}\to$$
$$\text{Lower Capacity} \to$$

**(Volatile):** Registers → CPU Cache → Main Memory → **(Non-Volatile):** Flash/USB Memory → Hard Disk → Tape Backup  
**Faster Access →**  
**Lower Capacity →**

#### Tape Storage

- Bits as **magnetic** information on tape
- **Very slow access** (10s of seconds)
- **Moderate read speed** (up to 300 MB/second)
- **Very cheap** (around $0.02 per Gigabyte)
- Used for long-term **archival** (e.g., by Google)

#### Hard Disk

Bits as **magnetic** information on platter

- Patters **spin** under read/write heads
- **Slow access** (10s of milliseconds access time)
- **Moderate read speed** (around 200 MB/second)
- **Cheap** (around $0.035 per Gigabyte)
- Used for **less frequently accessed** data

#### Solid State Drives SSD

- Bits as small **electric charges**
- **Elevated price** (around $0.25 per Gigabyte)
- **Fast access** (around 1 millisecond)
- **Elevated speed** (around 500 MB/second)
- Limited number of write cycles (**memory wear**)

#### Main Memory

- Bits as small **electric** charges
- **Expensive** (several dollars per Gigabyte)
- **Very fast access** (order of nanoseconds)
- **High bandwidth** (Gigabytes per second)
- Used to access **hot** data - **all** if economically feasible!

#### Cache

- Bits as small **electric** charges
- Typically organized as cache **hierarchy**
- **Very expensive** (hundreds of dollars per Gigabyte)
- **Near-instantaneous** access (few nanoseconds)
- **Very high bandwidth** (tens of Gigabytes per second)
- Used to store **immediately relevant** data

### Format - relation representation

#### Tables as Files

- Table schema === database catalog; 每个 page 的一个 row
- Table content $\in$ **collection of pages** called file
- page
  - a few KB for each page
  - might not enough for entire table (only multiple rows)

#### Files to Pages

1. Store pages as **doubly linked list**![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 6.03.39 PM.png]]
   - pointer to prev/next
   - separate by full/partially/empty pages
   - header reference in DB catalog
2. **Directory** with pointers to pages![[Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 6.03.55 PM.png]]
   - Directory pages reference **data pages with meta-data**

#### Pages to Slots

- Pages are divided into **slots**
- Each slot stores one **record** (i.e., table row)
- Can refer to records via **(pageID, slotID)**
- Multiple ways to **divide** pages into slots

##### **Fixed**-length

- Number of bytes per slot is determined **a-priori**
- Need to keep track of which slots are **used** (insertions ...)
- **Packed** representation uses consecutive slots
- Only keep track of **number** of slots used
- **Unpacked** representation allows unused slots in-between
- Need **bitmap** to keep track of used slots

##### **variable**-length records

- E.g., records with variable-length **text** fields
- Number of bytes per slot is **not fixed** a-priori
- Each page maintains **directory** about used slots
- Store **first byte** and length of slots
- **Flexibility** to move around records on page
- Can use that for regular **compaction**

#### Slots to Fields

- Must divide each slots into **fields**
- **Fixed** length field: store field sizes in DB **catalog**
- **variable** length field: store field sizes on **page**
- Option 1: use special **delimiter symbol** between fields
- Option 2: store "**field directory**" at beginning of record
