### Queries

describes a _new relation_ to generate

- `SELECT`: describes _columns_ of relation to generate
- `FROM`: describes _source_ relations and how to match
- `WHERE`: defines _conditions_ result rows must satisfy
- `select * from courses where cid = 1;`

#### Query with Joins

```
SELECT <column1, column2>
	FROM <table1>
	JOIN <table2> ON (<join-conditions>)
		...
WHERE <additional-conditions>
////
SELECT S.Sname
FROM Students S
	JOIN Enrollment E ON (S.sid = E.sid)
	JOIN Courses C ON (E.cid = C.cid)
WHERE C.Cname = 'CS4320'
```

#### Predicates

- inequalities: `>, >=`
- not equal: `<>`
- if in list: `Cname IN ('CS1111', 'CS2222')`
- Regex: `Cname LIKE 'CS_320&'`
  - `%`: zero or more arbitrary characters
  - `_`: one arbitrary character
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`: `Cname = 'CS4320' OR Cname = 'CS5320'`

#### Clauses

##### Select multiple columns

- `*` for all
  - `<table>.*` select all columns from table

##### Arithmetic

- `SELECT 3 * (<column1> + <column2>)`

##### Assign names

- `SELECT Sname as StudentName`

##### Join

- combine rows from tables based on a related columns
- `<table1> JOIN <table2> USING (<column>)`
  - `<table1> JOIN <table2> ON (<table1>.<column> = <table2>.<column>)`
  - Equivalent: `FROM <table1>, <table2> WHERE <join-condition>`
- `NATURAL JOIN`
  - `<table1> NATURAL JOIN <table2>`
  - Equalities btw ALL columns with same name
- `OUTER JOIN` (不用关心有 null 的数据)
  - Eliminates rows in other table, keep regardless
  - Fills up fields in missing row with _NULL_ values
  - **keep left table**: `<table-1> LEFT OUTER JOIN <table-2> ON ..`
  - **keep right table**: `<table-1> RIGHT OUTER JOIN <table-2> ON ..`
  - **keep both tables**: `<table-1> FULL OUTER JOIN <table-2> ON ..`

##### Distinct

- generate the unique rows
  - `SELECT DISTINCT`

##### Aggregation over ROWs

- `COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX`
  - `SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX`: numerical expression parameter
  - `COUNT(*)` for counting rows in result relation
  - `COUNT(<column>)` counts rows with value in column
  - `COUNT(DISTINCT <column>`) counts number of distinct values in column in result relation
  ```
  SELECT Count(*)
  FROM Students
  	JOIN Enrollment ON (Students.sid = Enrollment.sid)
  	JOIN Courses ON (Enrollment.cid = Courses.cid)
  WHERE Courses.Cname = 'CS4320'
  ```

##### Aggregation over GROUPS

- `GROUP-BY` for multiple data subsets
  - `GROUP BY <column-list>` - distinguish data subsets based on their values in specified columns
- Result contains **one row per group**
  - Implies _restrictions_ on SELECT clause!
  - Only expressions with _unique_ value per group
  - This includes _aggregates_ and _grouping_ columns
- Put _WHERE_ before grouping
- Put _HAVING_ after grouping
  ```
  SELECT Count(*), Cname
  FROM Students
  	JOIN Enrollment ON (Students.sid = Enrollment.sid)
  	JOIN Courses ON (Enrollment.cid = Courses.cid)
  WHERE Cname IN ('CS4320', 'CS5320')
  GROUP BY Cname
  HAVING Count(*) >= 100
  ```

##### ORDER BY

- `ORDER BY <Column2 ASC, Column2 DESC>`
- Prioritize the earlier items
- Applied _after_ grouping (for group-by queries)
  • Items must have _unique_ value per group

##### LIMIT

- `Limit <Number>`: first numbers of rows

##### NULL

- Unknown values
- Ternary
  - Result can be TRUE > UNKNOWN > FALSE ==(按这个 priority 分辨)==
  - If _NULL_ in _comparison operation (=)_, no rows will be returned.
  - ==\*`TRUE` dominates in `OR` operations (anything OR `TRUE` is `TRUE`).==
  - ==`FALSE` dominates in `AND` operations (anything AND `FALSE` is `FALSE`).==
  - ==`NULL` (Unknown) propagates when the result can't be definitively determined by the other operand.==
- Any comparison with NULL gets unknown result
- `<expression> = TRUE`
- `<expression> = FALSE`
- `<expression> IS NULL` (not `= NULL`).
- Example
  - `SELECT 3 = NULL;` - UNKNOWN
  - `SELECT NULL = NULL;` - UNKNOWN
  - `SELECT NULL IS NULL;` - TRUE
  - `SELECT NULL IS NOT NULL;` - FALSE
  - `SELECT TRUE OR NULL;` - TRUE
  - `SELECT TRUE AND NULL;` - UNKNOWN

##### SET (2 queries must be union-compatible)

- UNION
  - get tuples about duplicates
  - `<query-1> UNION <query-2>` : eliminates duplicates
  - `<query-1> UNION ALL <query-2>` : keep duplicates
- Intersect
  - result from 2 queries
  - `<query-1> INTERSECT <query-2>`
- EXCEPT
  - diff btw queries
  - `<query-1> EXCEPT <query-2>`

##### Query Nesting:

把 query 塞到 FROM, WHERE, SELECT ... clause

- Sub-Query $\in$ Query
- Uncorrelated - can be executed independently
  - `SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = (SELECT department FROM departments WHERE manager = 'John');`
- Correlated - depends on outer query
  - `SELECT name FROM employees e WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department);`
- UnCorrelated Sub-Query IN Conditions
  - EXISTS
    - `EXISTS(<sub-query>)` : TRUE if non-empty
  - IN
    - `<value> IN (<sub-query>)` : TRUE if contained
  - for all / some: $\forall$ / $\exists$
    - `<value> >= ALL(<sub-query>)`: TRUE if satisfied for all
    - `<value> >= ANY(<sub-query>)`: TRUE if satisfied for some
