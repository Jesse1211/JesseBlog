### Database Management System

<!-- ![DBMS](/image/DBMS.jpg) -->

Manage data, allows applications to store, update and analyze the data and avoids Code, Data Overlap, Inconsistencies

- Layer 1: Query Processor (Operators, Cost Estimation, Query Optimization)
- Optimizer - Generates access plans which satisfy the query request and selects the minimum cost as the final access plan
  - Rewriter - Convert to higher performance command
  - Executor - Execute
- Layer 2: Storage Manager (Storage Media)
  - Data Access - Handles access to the data stored in various storage media.
  - Buffer Manager - temporarily store data during processing.
  - Indexes, Filed, Data Layout - Organizes data and indexes in storage for efficient retrieval.
- Layer 3: Transaction Processing
  - Concurrency Control - Manages concurrent access to the database to ensure consistency.
  - Crash Recovery - Restores the system to a consistent state in the event of a crash.
  - Transaction Manager - Ensures that all database transactions are processed correctly and ensures ACID properties.
  - Recovery Manager
- Layer 4: Data
  - Schema Design - Designs the database schema and ensures efficient organization of data.
  - Detecting Redundancy - Identifies and eliminates redundancy in the database schema.
  - Schema Normalization - Normalizes the database schema to avoid anomalies.
  - Distributed Process (NoSQL and NewSQL) - Handles data distribution across multiple nodes, especially in distributed and NoSQL databases
  - Graph Data, Data Streams, Spatial Data - Manages specialized data types like graph data, streaming data, and spatial data.
